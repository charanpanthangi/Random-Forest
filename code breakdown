Code Breakdown:
Loading the Dataset:

Load your dataset using pd.read_csv() and specify your file path.
Univariate and Bivariate Analysis:

univariate_analysis(): This function plots the distribution of a single feature.
bivariate_analysis(): This function plots the relationship between two features.
Train-Test Split:

train_test_split() is used to split the dataset into training and testing sets for both classification and regression tasks.
Random Forest Classifier:

Trained using RandomForestClassifier(), then we evaluate using accuracy and classification report.
The model is saved using pickle.
Random Forest Regressor:

Trained using RandomForestRegressor(), evaluated using mean squared error.
The model is also saved using pickle.
Loading the Model and Passing New Input:

The saved .pkl files are loaded using pickle.load() and then used for predictions with a new input.
Make sure to replace feature1, feature2, feature3, target_class, and target_regression with the actual column names from your dataset.
