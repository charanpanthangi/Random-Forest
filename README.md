# Random Forest Classifier & Regression Model

This repository demonstrates the implementation of both a Random Forest Classifier and a Random Forest Regressor model using Python. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the trained models as `.pkl` files. Additionally, the repository covers univariate and bivariate analysis of the dataset.

## Overview

In this project, we perform both classification and regression tasks using Random Forest models. We:
- Conduct univariate and bivariate analysis on the dataset.
- Train a Random Forest Classifier for classification.
- Train a Random Forest Regressor for regression.
- Evaluate the models on test data.
- Save the trained models as `.pkl` files.
- Load the models and make predictions on new input data.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `seaborn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pickle`
  - `scipy`

You can install the dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/random-forest-classifier-regressor.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd random-forest-classifier-regressor
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

The project uses a custom dataset for both classification and regression tasks. Replace `'your_data.csv'` with your dataset file in the script. The dataset should have:
- **Features** (e.g., `feature1`, `feature2`, etc.)
- **Target** for classification (`target_class`)
- **Target** for regression (`target_regression`)

## Univariate & Bivariate Analysis

- **Univariate Analysis**: Visualizes the distribution of a single feature.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Visualizes the relationship between two variables (feature vs target).

Example plots are generated using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`.

## Random Forest Classifier

We implement a Random Forest Classifier using `RandomForestClassifier` from `scikit-learn`. After splitting the dataset into training and testing sets:
- The model is trained on the training set.
- Predictions are made on the testing set.
- Classification accuracy and report are printed.

## Random Forest Regressor

We implement a Random Forest Regressor using `RandomForestRegressor`. Similar to the classification process:
- The model is trained on the training set.
- Predictions are made on the testing set.
- The mean squared error is calculated and printed.

## Model Saving & Loading

After training, both the classifier and regressor models are saved as `.pkl` files using the `pickle` library. These models can be loaded later to make predictions on new input data without retraining.

## Usage

To train and evaluate the models:

1. Replace `'your_data.csv'` in the script with your dataset path.
2. Run the Python script to train the models, evaluate them, and save the models:

```bash
python random_forest_model.py
```

To load the trained models and make predictions on new input data:

1. Use the provided code in the script to load the saved `.pkl` models.
2. Pass new input data as a NumPy array to make predictions:

```python
new_input = np.array([[1.5, 2.5, 3.0]])  # Replace with actual values
class_prediction = loaded_classifier.predict(new_input)
regression_prediction = loaded_regressor.predict(new_input)
```

## Results

- The classification model's accuracy and classification report will be printed.
- The regression model's mean squared error will be displayed.
- Example input predictions for both models will be shown.
